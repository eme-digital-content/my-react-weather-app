# My Weather APP in React

It's a basic Weather App, based on React framework. The App was my final project for SheCodes React course.

Using My Weather App, you can check:

- The current weather in any city around the world through the search bar.
- The forecast for the next five days.
- 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments :)
